# Learning Splunk + Wireshark (SOC Home Lab)

This repository documents my journey learning Splunk Enterprise and Wireshark inside a small SOC-style home lab. 

I'm using this setup to understand:

- Windows event logging
- Splunk searches and filtering
- Dashboard creation
- Packet capture and analysis
- Troubleshooting ingestion issues
- Writing simple incident notes

This repo will expand as I learn more and experiment with detection logic and network analysis.

This SOC lab is an extension of my **Windows Active Directory Home Lab**, where I originally built:

- A domain controller (DC01)
- A Windows workstation (WS01)
- DNS, DHCP, and AD DS configuration
- Users, groups, and GPO policies

That same WS01 machine is now being used for Splunk Enterprise and Wireshark analysis in this repository.
